# Clothing Store Website (HTML5 + CSS3 Project)

## 📝 Description
This is my second personal project, built after learning the basics of HTML5 and CSS3.  
It simulates a basic clothing store landing page, including header, product sections, and contact info.

The project focuses on:
- Using semantic HTML5 tags for better structure and accessibility
- Applying modern CSS3 features for styling and layout
- Designing a clean, responsive structure with product previews

## 🎯 Objectives
- Practice HTML5 semantic elements: `header`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`, etc.
- Use CSS3 properties like `box-shadow`, `border-radius`, `transition`, and Google Fonts
- Design sections for:
  - Store introduction
  - Featured clothing items
  - Contact or subscription form

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with transitions, layout, spacing, and basic responsiveness)

## 📁 Files
- `index.html`: full structure of the page
- `style.css`: visual styling for layout, typography, and effects

## 📌 Notes
- This project helped me organize larger content blocks using semantic tags.
- I practiced styling product cards and using transitions for better UI/UX.
